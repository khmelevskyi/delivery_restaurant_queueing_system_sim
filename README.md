# delivery_restaurant_queueing_system_sim
This project is the simulation model of the queueing system of the restaurant with delivery and part of the course work 'Development of a simulation model for a queueing system with Poisson arrival streams'

The main functionality of this project is based on SimPy. [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python


## How to setup and run it

* `python3 -m venv .venv` - create a virtual enviroment
* `source .venv/bin/activate` - activate the virtual environment
* `pip install --upgrade pip` - update pip python package manager
* `pip install -r requirements.txt ` - install the required packages into the virtual environment
* `python3 main.py` - run the simulation
